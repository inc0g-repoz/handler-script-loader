# Handler Script Loader
A loader for event handlers from [LTSE] scripts. Allows developers to manage [LTSE] scripts and use them for handling events on Spigot servers.

### Compatibility
Only tested on 1.20.4, but should work on any versions of Spigot and Paper servers unless they are using a deprecated API.

### Dependencies
The dependencies required for building are listed below:
- [Spigot-API] – can be grabbed from the libraries bundle of your server (provided);
- [LTSE] – should be cloned from the respective repository (compile).
